# 🧵 Twitter Thread: FernAssist AAC-Powered Robot Assistant

## Tweet 1/8
🚀 Big day working on FernAssist - my AAC-powered robot assistant!

Spent today setting up the complete pipeline architecture and finalizing the LLM → ROS2 bridge. 

This is going to help people with communication disabilities control robots using natural language! 🤖

📱 The vision: Someone uses their AAC app to say "I'm thirsty, bring me water"

The system processes this through:
• AAC Input → 🧠 LLM Processing → 👁️ Object Detection → 🤖 Robot Control → 📢 Feedback

Today I built the complete pipeline architecture and UI flow!

🔧 Technical setup today:

• Set up ROS2 workspace with custom message types
• Created feedback module with TTS + visual feedback
• Built simulation runner for Isaac Sim integration
• Designed LLM interpreter with context memory
• Integrated YOLOv8 object detection pipeline

Lots of moving parts! ⚙️

🧠 The LLM → ROS2 bridge is the key piece:

Takes natural language like "bring me water" and converts it to structured robot commands:
```json
{
  "action": "fetch",
  "object": "water bottle", 
  "location": "kitchen counter",
  "robot": "TurtleBot"
}
```

This is where the magic happens! ✨

🎬 Made a simple POC demo today to show what the final pipeline results should look like:

Watch it process a request, detect objects, plan robot actions, and provide multi-modal feedback - all in real-time!

This is just the architecture demo, but it shows the complete user experience flow! 🎯

📊 Demo shows:
• 📱 AAC input processing
• 🧠 LLM intent analysis  
• 👁️ YOLOv8 object detection
• 🤖 Robot action planning
• 📢 Multi-modal feedback (TTS + visual)

Next step: Replace simulation with real AI models and robot control!

🎯 What's next:
• Set up real LLM API integration (OpenAI/Gemini)
• Install YOLOv8 for actual object detection
• Connect to real robots (TurtleBot, Franka)
• Test in Isaac Sim environments
• Add error handling and recovery

The foundation is solid! 🏗️

💡 The goal: Make robot control accessible to everyone, regardless of communication abilities.

Today's POC shows the complete user journey from AAC input to robot action. The architecture is ready - now it's time to make it real! 

Excited to share more progress soon! 🚀
